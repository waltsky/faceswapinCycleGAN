# faceswapinCycleGAN
This project is mainly deepfake's implementation in Pytorch plus the perceptual loss and CycleGAN things.  
It's highly inspired by shaoanlu's work in https://github.com/shaoanlu/faceswap-GAN.  
I also used his network architecture config and loss weights config cuz i don't want to train it from scratch, it's better for unexperienced people like me not to worry too much about the hyper parameter things.  
Anyway, I still make this project because my master dissertation is about it, I need an implementation made by myself:)  
# the face swap things
I think my project is mainly about three topics:  
* 1.Neural Style Transfer.  
* 2.Deepfake.   
* 3.CycleGAN.
# to be continued
Compared to traditional GANs. This project is more complex. First the generated result(fake imgs) can be divided into two types: maskfake and fake. Also at the backward phase for discrimination, there are a lot of options such as the eye_move_loss, edge_loss that you can choose to calculate. At the backward phase for generator, you also have two choices, the specific one is to calculate cycle_loss. In this mode, the fake one is not generated by the original class it self, but generated by another class.
